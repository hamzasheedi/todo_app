# Frontend State Manager Skill

## Purpose

This skill should be used when managing frontend state with Next.js App Router, server components for data fetching, client components for interactivity, and comprehensive error handling for the Phase II Todo Full-Stack Web Application. The skill focuses on creating efficient, maintainable, and user-friendly state management patterns.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Implementing state management for Next.js applications
- Creating server components for data fetching
- Building client components for interactivity
- Managing authentication and user state
- Implementing global application state
- Handling error boundaries and loading states

## How to Use This Skill

### Server Components Strategy
1. Use server components for data fetching and initial rendering
2. Implement proper data fetching with error handling
3. Add loading states and skeleton screens
4. Optimize server components for performance
5. Implement proper caching strategies
6. Use suspense for async operations
7. Ensure proper SEO with server rendering

### Client Components Strategy
1. Use client components for interactive elements
2. Implement proper state management with React hooks
3. Add event handling and user interactions
4. Optimize client components for performance
5. Implement proper hydration strategies
6. Use context providers for global state
7. Ensure proper error boundaries

### State Management Patterns
1. Implement global state with React Context
2. Use custom hooks for complex state logic
3. Implement proper state normalization
4. Add state persistence where appropriate
5. Create state validation and error handling
6. Implement proper state synchronization
7. Optimize state updates for performance

### Error Handling
1. Implement error boundaries at component level
2. Add proper error display components
3. Include graceful error recovery
4. Implement proper logging and monitoring
5. Add user-friendly error messages
6. Include error reporting mechanisms
7. Ensure consistent error handling patterns

### Performance Optimization
1. Implement proper component memoization
2. Optimize state updates and re-renders
3. Use lazy loading for non-critical components
4. Implement proper caching strategies
5. Optimize bundle size and loading times
6. Add proper code splitting
7. Monitor performance metrics

## Available Resources

### Component Templates
- Use templates in `/frontend/components/templates/` for creating new components
- Follow established patterns for consistency
- Include proper TypeScript interfaces for props
- Implement proper error boundaries and loading states

### Context Providers
- Reference `/frontend/contexts/` for global state management
- Follow established patterns for consistency
- Include proper TypeScript interfaces
- Implement proper error handling and validation

### Custom Hooks
- Use `/frontend/hooks/` for custom React hooks
- Follow established patterns for consistency
- Include proper TypeScript interfaces
- Implement proper error handling and validation

### API Integration
- Reference `/frontend/lib/api-client.ts` for API client implementation
- Use proper error handling and loading states
- Implement proper authentication token management
- Follow consistent API interaction patterns

## Output Standards

When managing frontend state:
1. Ensure proper separation between server and client components
2. Include comprehensive error handling and boundary management
3. Implement efficient state management patterns
4. Use proper TypeScript interfaces and type safety
5. Document all state management patterns with proper examples
6. Implement proper performance optimization
7. Optimize for Core Web Vitals and performance metrics
8. Follow React and Next.js best practices
9. Test all state management patterns thoroughly
10. Maintain consistent patterns across the application
