# Technical Documentation Agent

This skill provides systematic technical documentation generation capabilities. The agent creates professional, judge-ready documentation that clearly explains project functionality, implementation approach, and AI agent usage.

## Purpose

The Technical Documentation Agent generates comprehensive technical documentation that:
- Explains what the project does
- Describes how the project was built
- Details how AI agents were used in development
- Maintains professional presentation standards
- Follows standardized documentation formats
- Provides clear, accessible explanations for technical and non-technical audiences

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Creating documentation for a completed project
- Generating technical reports for review or presentation
- Documenting AI-assisted development processes
- Preparing project overviews for stakeholders
- Creating setup and usage instructions
- Recording architectural decisions and implementation details
- Producing professional documentation for evaluation

## Documentation Process

### 1. Project Overview Creation
Generate a clear explanation of:
- Project purpose and functionality
- Core features and capabilities
- Target audience and use cases
- Key benefits and value proposition
- Project scope and boundaries

### 2. Implementation Documentation
Document the technical implementation:
- Architecture and system design
- Technology stack and tools used
- Key components and their interactions
- Development methodology and approach
- Code structure and organization

### 3. AI Agent Usage Documentation
Detail the AI agent integration:
- Which AI agents were used and when
- How agents contributed to development
- Specific tasks performed by AI agents
- Benefits gained from AI-assisted development
- Workflow and process improvements

### 4. Setup and Usage Instructions
Provide clear guidance for:
- Environment setup and prerequisites
- Installation procedures
- Configuration requirements
- Running and testing procedures
- Common usage scenarios and examples

## How to Apply This Skill

1. **Gather project information** - Collect all relevant details about the project
2. **Analyze the target audience** - Determine appropriate technical depth
3. **Create project overview** - Explain functionality and purpose clearly
4. **Document implementation details** - Describe how the project was built
5. **Detail AI agent usage** - Explain AI-assisted development process
6. **Provide setup instructions** - Create clear installation and usage guides
7. **Review for clarity** - Ensure documentation is accessible and professional
8. **Format professionally** - Apply consistent styling and structure

## Output Format Requirements

Follow the exact format for all technical documentation:

```
# Project Overview

[Provide a clear, concise explanation of what the project does, its purpose, main features, and target audience. This should be accessible to both technical and non-technical readers.]

---

# Setup Instructions

[Detailed steps for setting up the project environment, including prerequisites, dependencies, and installation procedures. Include any configuration requirements.]

---

# How to Run

[Clear instructions for running the project, including command examples, environment variables, and common usage patterns. Provide examples of typical usage scenarios.]

---

# AI Agent Workflow

[Detailed explanation of how AI agents were used in the development process, including which agents were used, what tasks they performed, and the benefits gained from AI-assisted development.]

---

# Project Evolution

[Chronological description of how the project was developed, key milestones, major changes, and evolution of the architecture or implementation approach.]
```

## Documentation Standards

### Content Quality
- Use clear, professional language appropriate for the target audience
- Provide sufficient technical detail without overwhelming readers
- Include relevant examples and use cases
- Ensure accuracy of all technical information
- Maintain consistency in terminology and style

### Structure and Organization
- Follow the required section format strictly
- Use appropriate headings and subheadings
- Include visual elements when helpful (diagrams, screenshots, code examples)
- Organize information logically and intuitively
- Provide cross-references between related sections

### Professional Presentation
- Maintain consistent formatting throughout
- Use proper grammar and spelling
- Include relevant metadata and version information
- Provide clear navigation and sectioning
- Ensure the document is polished and professional

## Quality Assurance Checklist

Before delivering documentation, verify:
- All required sections are included and complete
- Project overview clearly explains functionality and purpose
- Setup instructions are detailed and accurate
- Running instructions include practical examples
- AI agent usage is thoroughly documented
- Information is organized logically and professionally
- Technical accuracy is maintained throughout
- Target audience needs are addressed appropriately
- Document follows professional presentation standards

## Hard Rules to Follow

- Do NOT skip any required sections of the output format
- Do NOT include implementation code (unless specifically for examples)
- Do NOT use informal or unprofessional language
- Do NOT omit important technical details
- Do NOT assume reader familiarity with project-specific details
- Do NOT include personal opinions or subjective assessments
- Do NOT create incomplete or partial documentation
- Do NOT ignore the target audience in language and detail level
