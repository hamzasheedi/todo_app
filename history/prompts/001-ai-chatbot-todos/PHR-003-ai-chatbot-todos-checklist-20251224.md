## Prompt

Phase III: Todo AI Chatbot (Hackathon)

Review the Phase III: Todo AI Chatbot (Basic Level Functionality) against its specification, plan, and tasks, and produce a checkpoint-driven quality checklist suitable for todo project.
The checklist must validate process discipline, architectural correctness, and functional completeness, not just code existence.
Checklist Goals
Ensure all hard constraints are satisfied
Enable human checkpoint review after each phase
Make progress verifiable, auditable, and judge-friendly
Prevent scope creep beyond Basic Level Functionality


Checklist Structure
Organize the checklist into phase-based checkpoints, similar to a research paper workflow.
For each checkpoint, include:
What must exist (artifacts, configs, files, behaviors)
What must be true (invariants, constraints, guarantees)
How to verify (observable evidence, logs, outputs)
Go / No-Go criteria (clear decision to proceed)

Required Checkpoints
✅ Checkpoint 1: Specification & Plan Readiness
Verify that:
Spec is complete, unambiguous, and scoped to Phase III
No implementation leakage in spec
Plan follows: Spec → Plan → Tasks → Implement
Tasks are atomic (15–30 min), reviewable, and traceable to spec
No manual coding requirement is explicitly stated

Go/No-Go Rule:
If any requirement cannot be traced to a task, stop.

✅ Checkpoint 2: Architecture & Infrastructure Setup
Verify that:
OpenAI Agents SDK is configured with Gemini-compatible base_url
Evidence exists that all AI calls route through Gemini
MCP Server is initialized using Official MCP SDK
No backend in-memory state exists
Database models match the specification exactly

Go/No-Go Rule:
If any AI call bypasses Gemini or MCP tools, stop.

✅ Checkpoint 3: MCP Tool Correctness
Verify that:
All required MCP tools exist: add, list, update, complete, delete
Tools are stateless and persist data via database
Tool schemas match spec (inputs/outputs)
Tools can be invoked independently
Errors are handled and returned cleanly

Go/No-Go Rule:
If any task mutation happens outside MCP tools, stop.

✅ Checkpoint 4: Stateless Chat Flow
Verify that:
Chat endpoint follows the full stateless lifecycle
Conversation + messages are persisted correctly
Server restart does not break conversations
Agent behavior matches the Agent Behavior Specification
Tool calls are logged and returned in responses

Go/No-Go Rule:
If conversation continuity depends on server memory, stop.

✅ Checkpoint 5: Natural Language Capability
Verify that:
All example natural language commands work
Agent selects correct MCP tools
Friendly confirmations are returned
Ambiguous inputs trigger clarification
Errors produce helpful, user-safe responses

Go/No-Go Rule:
If NL commands fail deterministically, stop.

✅ Checkpoint 6: Frontend (ChatKit UI)
Verify that:
ChatKit UI is integrated and functional
Auth context is enforced
Requests hit the stateless chat endpoint
Loading, errors, and confirmations are visible
Domain allowlist & domain key are configured (if hosted)

Go/No-Go Rule:
If frontend bypasses the chat API or agent, stop.

✅ Checkpoint 7: Cross-Cutting Quality Gates
Verify that:
Pagination limits are enforced (e.g., 50 tasks)
Logging covers MCP tool usage
All FRs and SCs are demonstrably met
README documents setup and constraints
Repo structure matches deliverables list

Go/No-Go Rule:
If any functional requirement cannot be demonstrated, stop.

Final Output
Produce:
A pass/fail checklist for each checkpoint
A short risk summary (what could fail in judging)
A final "Ready Todo Project" decision

The checklist must be:
Non-technical-reviewer friendly
Evidence-driven (not opinion-based)
Aligned strictly with Phase III Basic Level Functionality


Suitable for todo project evaluation and replay
